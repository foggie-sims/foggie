# FOGGIE Documentation README

This directory can be used for building documentation related to the FOGGIE simulations
and the analysis codes in this `foggie` repository. Documentation source files are in
the `source` directory. The documentation uses [ReST formatting](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html)
and is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html).
Sphinx is included as a dependency if the `foggie` repository was installed as a package.

To build the documentation, run e.g. `make html`. Other available formats can be seen using `make help`. The resulting build will be in a `./build/<format>` directory.
