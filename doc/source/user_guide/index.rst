User Guide - Analysis
=====================

This guide collects all the little bits of documentation for how to load in and
analyze FOGGIE datasets, and for using the existing code in the FOGGIE GitHub Repository.

If this is your first time analyzing the FOGGIE simulations, start with the
`Getting Started with FOGGIE <getting_started.html>`_ page.

Below, you'll find links to the documentation that describes how to use other
analysis codes within the repo.

=====================

This guide collects information about how to run new simulations that are a similar

or for restarting an existing FOGGIE simulation from a certain snapshot.
