This directory is meant to contain a set of python scripts to create mock IFU datacubes from FOGGIE simulations. I will rename it to something more meaningful once there are more scripts here.
For now, this is really just an initial attempt to look at the FOGGIE data.

File Name: header.py
Description: Header file importing packages/modules required for working with FOGGIE code.

File Name: projection_plot.py
Description: Initial attempts to play around with FOGGIE outputs, make projection plots.
