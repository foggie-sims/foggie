# The KH Test problem creates two fluids moving antiparallel to each other
# in a periodic 2D grid (inner fluid and outer fluid).  The inside fluid
# has a higher density than the outside fluid.  There is a slight ramp region
# in density and x-velocity connecting the two regions so there are no
# discontinuities in the flow.  The y-velocity is perturbed with small sinusoidal
# perturbation.  As the flows shear past each other, the KH instability
# is excited, which develops over time.  This test watches the evolution of
# those instabilities.  --Cameron Hummels, 2013
