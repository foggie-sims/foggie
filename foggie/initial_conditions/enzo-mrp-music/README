Description
===========
The scripts included in this package run MUSIC after setting the
necessary parameters to their correct values to focus on a Lagrangian
volume of some halo.

Usage
=====

$ python enzo-mrp-music.py <config-file> <level>

<config-file> is the configuration file. See sample.conf for an
example.

<level> is the finest level in the initial conditions to be generated.

This script can be run in parallel that will use multiple cores for
the particle identification and searching in yt.

$ mpirun -n <number-of-cores> python enzo-mrp.music.py <level>

Procedure
=========

1. Collect parameters from the original set of initial conditions
   (ICs) to obtain the shift of the box.

2. Given a halo position and mass, it will calculate the Lagrangian
   volume (LV) at the initial redshift.

3. With this LV, it will modify the appropriate parameters and supply
   a particle position list to MUSIC.  Afterwards, MUSIC is
   automatically executed.

   * Four options for the LV are given: box, ellipsoid, convex hull,
     or exact.

4. The initial conditions directory is then moved to some
   user-specified location.

Example workflow
================

1. Create a set of initial conditions for a unigrid simulation with
   MUSIC. Its parameter file needs to be references in this script's
   configuration file (e.g. sample.conf) as the variable
   template_config.  See template.conf for an example.
   
2. Run unigrid simulation (If an iteration after step #7, run zoom-in
   simulation.)

3. Find halo of interest in the last output

4. Modify parameters in the [region] section in the configuration file
   (e.g. sample.conf). The parameters are documented above their
   declaration.
   
5. Run "python enzo-mrp-music.py sample.conf 1"

6. Run simulation with 1 nested grid with the appropriate Enzo
   parameter file.  MUSIC will only give a skeleton parameter file,
   but the must-refine and nested grid parameters are given in it.
   
7. If another nested grid is needed, goto step #2 and increase the
   level argument by 1.  If not, you're finished!
