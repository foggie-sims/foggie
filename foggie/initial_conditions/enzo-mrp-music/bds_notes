This is a code that works with both yt and MUSIC.  What you do is
give it the center and radius of the halo you want to resimulate
at higher resolution.  This will grab all of the particle ids within
3 virial radii of that halo and calculate the size of the lagrangian
region.  It will feed this directly into MUSIC and generate the new
ICs with one additional nested level.

The instructions are pretty good, but there may be a couple tricks
for naming files correctly.  It will want your simulation with no
initial refinement to be something like SIMULATIONNAME_L0, and will
make the next one L1 after that runs, you’ll need to edit a few
values in the parameter file

1. Divide the values in MinimumOverDensityForRefinement by 8
2. For the parameter CellFlaggingMethod, add a new entry 8
      8 is the method for refining by must-refine-particles

3. add these two lines:
```MustRefineParticlesCreateParticles = 3 # this should stay three
MustRefineParticlesRefineToLevel = 1 # increase this each time you make ICs with more levels```

4. MUSIC will create a template parameter file called `parameter_file.txt`, in there, you’ll need to copy lines into your parameter file containing the geometry of the nested regions, they look like below,
For example, this is two levels of refinement:
```CosmologySimulationParticleTypeName          = RefinementMask
CosmologySimulationCalculatePositions    = 1
CosmologySimulationNumberOfInitialGrids  = 3
CosmologySimulationGridDimension[1]      =               40               30               32
CosmologySimulationGridLeftEdge[1]       =        0.4609375       0.47265625       0.47265625
CosmologySimulationGridRightEdge[1]      =        0.5390625          0.53125       0.53515625
CosmologySimulationGridLevel[1]          = 1
CosmologySimulationGridDimension[2]      =               62               40               48
CosmologySimulationGridLeftEdge[2]       =      0.470703125      0.482421875       0.48046875
CosmologySimulationGridRightEdge[2]      =          0.53125      0.521484375       0.52734375
CosmologySimulationGridLevel[2]          = 2```
don’t add any others from the template file
