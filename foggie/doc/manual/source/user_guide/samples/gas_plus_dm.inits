#  Generates initial grid and particle fields for a single-grid
#    CDM simulation - that is to say, a cosmology simulation 
#    where the initial conditions are not nested.
#
#  Note:  This file is by inits.exe with the command line 
#    'inits.exe -d gas_plus_dm.inits' and outputs four files, called
#    GridDensity, GridVelocities, ParticlePositions, and 
#    ParticleVelocities.  Enzo then reads these files in using its
#    own parameter file.
