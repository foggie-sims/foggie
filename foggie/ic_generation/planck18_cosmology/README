- Using online tool https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/toolbox/camb_online.html
- Set parameters according to adopted values. 
	- turn reionization off 
	- sigma_8 is not an input parameter 
		- iterate on A_s until sigma_8 = 0.81 in the results (z = 0) 
		- A_s scalar amplitude = 1.66e-9 
		- generate transfer functions for z = 99 and z = 0 
	- see stored PDF of inputs for verification 
- results in ~foggie/ic_generation
- the file camb_47799596_transfer_z99 will feed into MUSIC
- see PDFs in these files for inputs and outputs
